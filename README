stopanalyser is a tool to parse ride GPS data in gpx format, to report stops.
I wrote it to be able to better analyse my stopping behavior, on long rides.
The lat-long info in the output is useful to lookup the location, to better recollect details.
I use a Garmin Edge 500, and I convert the fit files to gpx, using gps-babel.

Usage:
-f: input file (GPX)
-g: granularity in minutes. -g5 would only output recorded stops which are longer than 5 minutes.
-u: UTC offset. The timestamps are in UTC. If your timezone differs, simply provide the offset value.

ex:
[pchengi@direwolf rideutils]$ python stopanalyzer.py -f test.gpx -g 5 -u 2
